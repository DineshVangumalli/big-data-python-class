# Basic setup code for the class

1. Python 2.7

Reccommend using the anaconda python 2.7.9 distribution since is comes with most of the desired packages.

2. Google App engine  ( for web development this is not as yet required but I am looking how to integrate this in the class)

3. And IDE - I have not decided as yet which will be be best ... But I am leaning towards spyder..
  a. pycharm by jetbrains:  https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/  ( get the education license if you are in my class)
  b. eclipse by eclipse: https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/
        but check first with ones are supported by:  (always free )
        pydev installed from the marketplace http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/pydev-python-ide-eclipse
  c. Spyder: https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder
  
  d.or just use test edit tools:
    i. vim:    http://www.vim.org/download.php
    ii. emacs:  windows version: http://sourceforge.net/projects/emacsbinw64/
